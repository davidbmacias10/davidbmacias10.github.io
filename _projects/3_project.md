## Project Summary

This project focuses on developing a valuation model for single-family residential properties, applying both the cost approach and market-based methods. Drawing from principles in the book *Real Estate Valuation Theory* by Manya M. Mooya, I am constructing a hybrid appraisal framework using structured data sourced via the Attom Data API. The goal is to create an automated valuation model (AVM) that blends theoretical rigor with real-world property data to estimate property values more accurately and transparently.

The project is currently a work in progress. I anticipate producing a fully operational and tested model by mid-summer 2025, complete with validation results and use-case demonstrations.

## Cost Approach Formula

In real estate appraisal, the **Cost Approach** estimates property value based on the cost to reproduce or replace the structure, minus depreciation, plus the land value. The general formula is:

> **Property Value = (Replacement/Reproduction Cost - Depreciation) + Land Value**

Where:
- **Replacement/Reproduction Cost**: The cost to build a similar property today.
- **Depreciation**: Loss in value from physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, or external obsolescence.
- **Land Value**: Estimated separately based on comparable land sales.

## Python Code Implementation

```python
def cost_approach(replacement_cost, depreciation_amount, land_value):
    """
    Calculate the estimated property value using the Cost Approach.

    Args:
        replacement_cost (float): Cost to replace or reproduce the structure.
        depreciation_amount (float): Estimated total depreciation.
        land_value (float): Estimated value of the land.

    Returns:
        float: Estimated total property value.
    """
    property_value = (replacement_cost - depreciation_amount) + land_value
    return property_value

# Example usage
replacement_cost = 250000  # dollars
depreciation_amount = 30000  # dollars
land_value = 50000  # dollars

estimated_value = cost_approach(replacement_cost, depreciation_amount, land_value)
print(f"Estimated Property Value: ${estimated_value:,.2f}")
