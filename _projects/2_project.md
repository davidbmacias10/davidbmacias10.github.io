  <h2>Project Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This project, titled <em>Machine Learning Based Approaches for the Classification of Astronomical Objects Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)</em>, explores how machine learning can be leveraged to classify the vast and ever-growing datasets produced by astronomical surveys. As traditional manual classification methods become infeasible with the scale of modern data, machine learning offers scalable, efficient, and reliable alternatives. Our work compares several machine learning classification algorithms, evaluates their performance before and after dimensionality reduction, and identifies the most effective models for astronomical object classification. Key findings highlight that Support Vector Machines (SVM)—particularly non-linear SVM—provided the highest classification accuracy without requiring dimensionality reduction. Hyperparameter tuning further improved the model, achieving up to 96% accuracy with optimized settings. This research supports the adoption of SVM-based methods for future astronomical classification projects and offers critical insights into managing high-dimensional data challenges in astrophysics.
