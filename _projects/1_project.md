In this project, with my experience in raw signal processing and machine learning prediction modeling, I processed raw sensor feeds into meaningful driver behavior. 
The data is from the US Department of Transportation and consists of about 28000 trips and 3500 drivers. It is composed of 1800 crashes, 6700 near-crashes and 19800 baseline trips.
This in turn was used to develop a prediction model based on the drivers with a collision and all their trips. 
Stats on trips of drivers who have crashed were used to develop a profile of what crash-prone driving characteristics look like.
XGBoost was used to test, train, fit and predict with a Train Score Accuracy of 98% and a Test Score Accuracy of 96%.

This model was then fed data on the driving behavior of drivers' trips who have never crashed. Drivers with similar driving behavior to those who have crashed  were flagged.
Redundancy to prevent overfitting was implemented with multiple versions of the XGBoost model. 
Crashless drivers who were flagged across multiple models on more of their trips were deemed riskier than drivers who were only flagged once on one model on a single trip.

These risk scores (and probabilities) can then be used to create and determine pricing adjustments for these drivers.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
