"Green Eggs and Ham" by Dr. Seuss is a whimsical and timeless classic that reminded me of the importance of curiosity, persistence, and open-mindedness. Though lighthearted, it reinforced lessons about trying new things and embracing unexpected experiencesâ€”an attitude that has served me well both personally and professionally.
