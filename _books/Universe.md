I doubted myself, I doubted that I had made the right choice when choosing to pursue a degree in Physics. Janna Levin, astrophysicist, says she struggled and doubted herself too. Not only did this book convince to continue and complete my major, and gave me a soft spot for all things astrophysics related. Love me some black holes and dark matter.
