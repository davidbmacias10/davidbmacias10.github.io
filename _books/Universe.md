Janna Levin's blend of personal narrative and complex cosmological concepts made this book a unique read. It deepened my appreciation for the universe's structure and the role of scientific inquiry in understanding our place within it. The book's exploration of the universe's shape and the nature of infinity challenged my thinking and inspired a more profound curiosity about the cosmos.
