This book provided an insightful roadmap to structuring and leading a successful analytics team. It's in the subtitle, but honestly, it answers questions that a first time manager in data teams wouldn't have thought of. It emphasizes the need for communication and outreach in making data more accessible and comprehensible to all stakeholders. It's my go-to guide when I need help setting a goal and path for the team.
