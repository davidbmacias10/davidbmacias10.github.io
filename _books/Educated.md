Tara Westover's *Educated* is a memoir where Dr Westover relates her pursuit and uphill battle in obtaining an education. Raised in a survivalist family that sidelined formal education and medical care, Westover's pursuit of knowledge was inspiring. Her story resonated deeply with me: my education wasn't a given but a privilege I had to fight for every day. I'm glad I did.
